# Making sense of the concepts

* Stationary:
  * We want time-series to be stationary \(no trend\) because we want to eliminate un-necessary correlation in our analysis.
  * If 2 time series both have upward trend, then our analysis will show they are having high correlation while they might have no relationship at all.
