# Markov Chain

Given the present state, the future states and past states are independent

* With M states, the Markov Chain can be described by the M \* M transition matrix
* There is an inital probability \(what is can the system be in at start\)
* Given the present state, the prob of possible path will be: $$P\left(X_{1}=i_{1}, X_{2}=i_{2} \cdots, X_{n}=i_{n} \mid X_{0}=i_{0}\right)=p_{i_{0} i} p_{i, i_{2}} \cdots p_{i_{n-1} i_{n}}$$
