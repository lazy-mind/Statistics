* $$R^2$$ : the goodness of fit
* **Kurtosis:** is a statistical measure that defines how heavily the tails of a distribution differ from the tails of a normal distribution. In other words, **kurtosis** identifies whether the tails of a given distribution contain extreme values.
* **skewness:** is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. The **skewness** value can be positive, zero, negative, or undefined
